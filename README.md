[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/party.donut/system.svg)](https://clojars.org/party.donut/system)

As a developer, one of your tasks is decomposing an application into logically
coherent, reusable, loosely-coupled components that can be understood and tested
in isolation. Another task is coordinating these components -- composing them in
a way that&rsquo;s coherent, such that the system as a whole remains
comprehensible and it&rsquo;s possible to grow, debug, and maintain the
application with minimal confusion.

donut.system is a *depdendency injection* library that helps you manage this
source of complexity. It helps you in the following ways:

- It provides *system* and *component* abstractions that give your application
  a comprehensible structure
- It provides a means of composing components
- It provides a structure for defining component behavior
- It makes loose coupling possible
- It makes it easier to test your system
- It aids in understanding the scope of your system and how the pieces interact

Examples of components you might need in your system include:

- A database threadpool
- A messaging or queueing system
- A job scheduler

Something that these components have in common is that they have stateful
behaviors, claiming resources like threads and reading and writing to other
resources. They could also have dependencies that determine the order in which
they're started and stopped: your job scheduler might use your database as its
data store, and therefore can't be started until after your db threadpool is
created. donut.system makes sure that these behaviors happen in the correct
order.

# Basic Usage

To use donut.system, you first define a _system_ that contains _component
groups_. Component groups contain _component definitions_. Component definitions
include _signal handlers_ that specify component behaviors.

Here's an example of a system definition:

``` clojure
(ns donut.examples.single-component
  (:require
   [donut.system :as ds]))

(def system
  {::ds/defs ;; <-- components defined under this key
   {:app ;; <-- component group name
    {:printer ;; <-- component name
     ;; ::ds/start and ::ds/stop are signal handlers
     #::ds{:start (fn [_]
                    (future
                      (loop []
                        (println "hello!")
                        (Thread/sleep 1000)
                        (recur))))
           :stop  (fn [{:keys [::ds/instance]}]
                    (future-cancel instance))}}}})
```

> **NOTE**: donut.system makes heavy use of _namespaced keywords_. If the
> `#::ds{:start ...}` syntax above is new to you, please [read this
> doc](docs/namespaced-keywords.org).

This example defines a `system` var (the name `system` is arbitrary). Its value
is a map that has one key, `::ds/defs`. This is where your component definitions
live. Systems are implemented as maps that contain the `::ds/defs` key.

The value of `::ds/defs` is a map, where the keys are names for component
groups. In this case, there's only one component group, `:app`. `:app` is an
arbitrary name with no special significance; you can use whatever keywords you
want for component group names.

Under the `:app` component group we have a map of where each key is the name of
the component and each value is the component's definition. A component
definition specifies the component's behavior. In this example, the `:printer`
component definition is a map that has two keys, `::ds/start` and `::ds/stop`.
These keys are names of _signal handlers_, which you'll learn about momentarily.
`::ds/start` and `::ds/stop` are both associated with a function. These
functions are where you specify a component's behavior.

**NB:** You cannot arbitrarily nest components. The top-level keys in the
`::ds/defs` map name component groups, and the keys in those maps name
component definitions. All of the `donut.system` signal handlers must be in
component definition maps, or they will be ignored. So, for example, this signal
handler will work: `{::ds/defs {:app {:printer #::ds{:start (fn [_] ...)}}}}` but
this one will not: `{::ds/defs {:app {:printer {:office #::ds{:start (fn [_] ...)}}}}}`.
In the second example, the `::ds/start` key and its fn value will appear as-is in
the started system instance because it's nested under an additional `:office` key.

Let's actually interact with this system and see its behavior: 

``` clojure
(let [running-system (ds/signal system ::ds/start)]
  (Thread/sleep 5000)
  (ds/signal running-system ::ds/stop))
```

If you run the above in a REPL, it will print `"hello!"` once a second for five
seconds and then stop. The function `ds/signal` takes a system as its argument
and "sends" the given signal (`::ds/start`) to the components in the system,
calling the corresponding signal handler function. This _signal_ and _send_
terminology is metaphorical; there's no network or sockets or anything like that
involved.

The return value of a signal handler becomes the component's _instance._ A
component instance is typically some object that you can use to stop the
component. `(ds/signal system ::ds/start)` returns an updated system map that
includes component instances. If you send another signal to the updated system
map, it can use those instances. In the example above, we call `(ds/signal
running-system ::ds/stop)` to send the `::ds/stop` signal, and its signal
handler cancels the future returned by the `::ds/start` signal handler.

Let's look at a slightly more complicated example. This system has two
components, a `:printer` component and a `:stack` component. When the system
receives the `:donut.system/start` signal, the `:printer` pops an item off the
`:stack` and prints it once a second:

``` clojure
(ns donut.examples.printer
  (:require [donut.system :as ds]))

(def system
  {::ds/defs
   {:services
    {:stack #::ds{:start  (fn [{:keys [::ds/config]}]
                            (atom (vec (range (:items config)))))
                  :config {:items 10}}}

    :app
    {:printer #::ds{:start  (fn [opts]
                              (let [stack (get-in opts [::ds/config :stack])]
                                (future
                                  (loop []
                                    (prn "peek:" (peek @stack))
                                    (swap! stack pop)
                                    (Thread/sleep 1000)
                                    (recur)))))
                    :stop   (fn [{:keys [::ds/instance]}]
                              (prn "stopping")
                              (future-cancel instance))
                    :config {:stack (ds/ref [:services :stack])}}}}})

;; start the system, let it run for 5 seconds, then stop it
(comment
  (let [running-system (ds/signal system ::ds/start)]
    (Thread/sleep 5000)
    (ds/signal running-system ::ds/stop)))
```

As before, `system` is a map that contains just one key, `::ds/defs`.
`::ds/defs` is a map of _component groups_, of which there are two: `:services`
and `:app`. The `:services` group has one component definition, `:stack`, and
the `:app` group has one component definition, `:printer`. 

Component definitions can contain `::ds/start` and `::ds/stop` signal handlers,
as well as a `::ds/config`. The `:printer` component's `:ds/config` contains a
_ref_ to the `:stack` component. You'll learn more about refs below; they allow
one component to refer to and use another component.

You start the system by calling `(ds/signal system ::ds/start)`. This produces an
updated system map (bound to `running-system`) which you then use when stopping
the system with `(ds/signal running-system :stop)`.

The rest of this README covers donut.system's pieces in more detail.

## Components

Components have _definitions_ and _instances._

### Component Definitions

A component definition (_component def_ or just _def_ for short) is an entry in
the `::ds/defs` map of a system map. A component definition can be a map, as
this system with a single component definition shows:

``` clojure
(def Stack
  #::ds{:start  (fn [{{:keys [items]} ::ds/config}] (atom (vec (range items))))
        :config {:items 10}})

(def system {::ds/defs {:services {:stack Stack}}})
```

Components are organized under _component groups_. I cover some interesting
things you can do with groups below, but for now you can just consider them an
organizational aid. This system map includes the component group `:services`.

(Note that there's no special reason to break out the `Stack` component
definition into a top-level var. I just thought it would make the example more
readable.)

A def map can contain _signal handlers_, which are used to create component
_instances_ and implement component behavior. A def can also contain additional
configuration values that will get passed to the signal handlers.

In the example above, we've defined a `::ds/start` signal handlers. Signal
handlers are just functions with one argument, a map. What is included in this
map?

This map includes the key `::ds/config`, and its value is taken from the
`::ds/config` key in your component definition. In the example above, that means
that the map will contain `{:items 10}`. You can see that the `::ds/start`
signal handler destructures `::ds/config` out of its first argument, and then
looks up `:items`.

(Other key/value pairs get added to the signal handler's map, and I'll cover
those as we need them.)

This approach to defining components lets us easily modify them. If you want to
mock out a component, you just have to use `assoc-in` to assign a new
`::ds/start` signal handler.

### Component Instances

Signal handlers return a _component instance_, which is stored in the system map
under `::ds/instances`. Try this to see a system's instances:

``` clojure
(::ds/instances (ds/signal system :start))
```

This is how you can access component instances for tests.

Component instances are added to the signal handler's argument under the
`::ds/instance` key. When you apply the `::ds/start` signal to a `Stack`
component, it creates a new atom, and when you apply the `::ds/stop` handler the
atom is passed in under `::ds/instance` key. In the example above, the
`::ds/stop` signal handler destructures this:

``` clojure
(fn [{::ds/keys [instance]}] (reset! instance []))
```

This is how you can allocate and deallocate the resources needed for your
system: the `::ds/start` handler will create a new object or connection or
thread pool or whatever, and place that in the system map under
`::ds/instances`. The `::ds/stop` handler can retrieve this instance, and it can
then call whatever functions or methods are needed to to deallocate the
resource.

You don't have to define a handler for every signal. Components that don't have
a handler for a signal are essentially skipped when you send a signal to a
system.

## Refs

Component defs can contains _refs_, references to other components that resolve
to that component's instance when signal handlers are called. Let's look at our
stack printer again:

``` clojure
(def system
  {::ds/defs
   {:services
    {:stack #::ds{:start  (fn [{:keys [::ds/config]}]
                            (atom (vec (range (:items config)))))
                  :config {:items 10}}}

    :app
    {:printer #::ds{:start  (fn [opts]
                              (let [stack (get-in opts [::ds/config :stack])]
                                (future
                                  (loop []
                                    (prn "peek:" (peek @stack))
                                    (swap! stack pop)
                                    (Thread/sleep 1000)
                                    (recur)))))
                    :stop   (fn [{:keys [::ds/instance]}]
                              (prn "stopping")
                              (future-cancel instance))
                    :config {:stack (ds/ref [:services :stack])}}}}})
```

The last line includes `{:stack (ds/ref [:services :stack])}`. `ds/ref` is a
function that returns a vector of the form `[:donut.system/ref component-key]`,
where `component-key` is a vector of the form `[group-name component-name]`.

These refs are used to determine the order in which signals are applied to
components. Since the `:printer` refers to the `:stack`, we know that it depends
on a `:stack` instance to function correctly. Therefore, when we send a
`:start` signal, it's handled by `:stack` before `:printer.`

Within `:printer`'s `:start` signal handler, `stack` refers to the atom created
by the `:stack` component.

When you call `(ds/signal system ::ds/start)`, the following happens:

1. The `::ds/start` signal handler for `[:services :stack]` gets called. It
   returns an atom, which becomes the component instance for `[:services
   :stack]`.
2. Internally, that atom is added to the system map under `[::ds/instances
   :services :stack]`.
3. The `::ds/start` signal handler for `[:app :printer]` gets called with a
   single argument, a map. That map includes the key path `[::ds/config
   :stack]`, and its value is the component instance for `[:services :stack]` --
   the atom created at step 1.

### Deep refs

If you have a component `[:group-a :component-a]` whose instance is a map like
`{:level-1 {:level-2 {:level-3 ...}}}` then you can refer to values within the
map with a ref like `(ds/ref [:group-a :component-a :level-1 :level-2
:level-3])`.

### Refs must be reachable

Note that a ref must be _reachable_ for it to be resolved, meaning that it must
be possible to use `(get-in system [::ds/defs :path :to :ref])` to retrieve the
ref. Something like this wont' work:

``` clojure
{::ds/defs {:app {:printer #::ds{:start (fn [_] (ds/ref [:services :stack]))}}}}
```

It won't work because you `ds/ref` resides inside a function definition that
isn't reachable by `get-in`.

## Constant instances

If a component is defined using any value other than a map that contains the
`:donut.system/start` key, that value is considered to be the component's
instance. This can be useful for configuration. Consider this system:

``` clojure
(ns donut.examples.ring
  (:require [donut.system :as ds]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :as rj]))

(def system
  {::ds/defs
   {:env  {:http-port 8080}
    :http {:server  #::ds{:start  (fn [{{:keys [handler options]} ::ds/config}]
                                    (rj/run-jetty handler options))
                          :stop   (fn [{::ds/keys [instance]}]
                                    (.stop instance))
                          :config {:handler (ds/local-ref [:handler])
                                   :options {:port  (ds/ref [:env :http-port])
                                             :join? false}}}
           :handler (fn [_req]
                      {:status  200
                       :headers {"ContentType" "text/html"}
                       :body    "It's donut.system, baby!"})}}})
```

The component `[:env :http-port]` is defined as the value `8080`. It's referred
to by the `[:http :server]` component. When the `[:http :server]`'s `:start`
handler is applied, it destructures `options` from its first argument. `options`
will be the map `{:port 8080, join? false}`.

This is just a little bit of sugar to make it easier to work with donut.system.
It would be annoying and possibly confusing to have to write something like

``` clojure
(def system
  {::ds/defs
   {:env {:http-port #::ds{:start (constantly 8080)}}}})
```

## Signals

We've seen how you can specify signal handlers for components, but what is a
signal? The best way to understand them is behaviorally: when you call the
`ds/signal` function on a system, then each component's signal handler gets
called in the correct order. I needed to convey the idea of "make all the
components do a thing", and signal handling seemed like a good metaphor.

Using the term "signal" could be misleading, though, in that it implies the use
of a communication primitive like a socket or a semaphor. That's not the case.
Internally, it's all just plain ol' function calls. If I talk about "sending" a
signal, nothing's actually being sent. And anyway, even if something were
getting sent, that shouldn't matter to you in using the library; it would be an
implementation detail that should be transparent to .

donut.system provides some sugar for built-in signals: instead of calling
`(ds/signal system ::ds/start)` you can call `(ds/start system)`.

## Custom signals

There's a more interesting reason for the use of _signal_, though: I want signal
handling to be extensible. Other component libraries use the term _lifecycle_,
which I think doesn't convey the sense of extensibility that's possible with
donut.system.

Out of the box, donut.system recognizes `::ds/start`, `::ds/stop`,
`::ds/suspend`, and `::ds/resume` signals, but it's possible to handle arbitrary
signals -- say, `:your.app/validate` or `:your.app/status`. To do that, you just
need to add a little configuration to your system:

``` clojure
(def system
  {::ds/defs    {;; components go here
                 }
   ::ds/signals {:your.app/status   {:order :topsort}
                 :your.app/validate {:order :reverse-topsort}}})
```

`::ds/signals` is a map where keys are signal names and values are configuration
maps. The configuration keys are:

**`:order`** values can be `:topsort` or `:reverse-topsort`. This specifies the
order that components' signal handlers should be called. `:topsort` means that
if Component A refers to Component B, then Component A's handler will be called
first; reverse is, well, the reverse.

**`:returns-instance?`** this determines whether the return value of the signal
handler should be used to update the system's instances, under `::ds/instances`.

The map you specify under `::ds/signals` will get merged with the default signal
map, which is:

``` clojure
(def default-signals
  "which graph sort order to follow to apply signal, and where to put result"
  {::start   {:order             :reverse-topsort
              :returns-instance? true}
   ::stop    {:order             :topsort
              :returns-instance? true}
   ::suspend {:order             :topsort
              :returns-instance? true}
   ::resume  {:order             :reverse-topsort
              :returns-instance? true}
   ::status  {:order :reverse-topsort}})
```

## Systems

Systems organize components and provide a consistent way to initiate component
behavior. You send a signal to a system, and the system ensures its components
handle the signal in the correct order.

As you've seen, systems are implemented as maps. I sometimes refer to these maps
as _system maps_ or _system states_. It can be useful, for example, to think of
`ds/signal` as taking a system state as an argument and returning a new state.

donut.system follows a pattern that you might be used to if you've used
interceptors: it places as much information as possible in the system map and
uses that to drive execution. This lets us do cool and useful stuff like define
custom signals.

One day I'd like to write more about the advantages of taking the "world in a
map" approach. In the mean time, [this Lambda Island blog post on Coffee
Grinders](https://lambdaisland.com/blog/2020-03-29-coffee-grinders-2) does a
good job of explaining it.

## Config helpers

`donut.system/named-system` is a multimethod you can use to register system
maps. This can be useful for defining dev, test, and prod systems:

``` clojure
(defmethod ds/named-system :test
  [_]
  {::ds/defs ...})
```

Often you'll want to customize a config; you'll want to replace a component with
a mock, for example. You can pass an additional argument to `ds/system` to
specify overrides:

``` clojure
(ds/system :test {[:services :queue] mock-queue})
```

You don't have to override an entire component. You can also override just a
signal handler:

``` clojure
(ds/system :test {[:services :queue ::ds/start] (fn mock-start-queue [_])})
```

Overrides are a map where keys are _def paths_, and values are whatever value
you want to be assoc'd in to that path under `::ds/defs`. The above code is
equivalent to this:

``` clojure
(update (ds/named-system :test)
        ::ds/defs
        (fn [defs]
          (reduce-kv (fn [new-defs path val]
                       (assoc-in new-defs path val))
                     defs
                     {[:services :queue :start] (fn mock-start-queue [_])})))
```

The signal helpers `ds/start`, `ds/stop`, `ds/suspend`, and `ds/resume` can take
either a system name or a system map, and can take optional overrides:

``` clojure
(ds/start :test) ;; <- system name
(ds/start {::ds/defs ...}) ;; <- system map

;; use named system, with overrides
(ds/start :test {[:services :queue] mock-queue})
```

The `start` helper also takes an optional third argument to select a subset of components start:

``` clojure
(ds/start :test 
          {[:services :queue] mock-queue}
          #{[:app :http-server]}) ;; <- component selection
```

Component selection is explained below.

## Reloaded REPL workflow

The `donut.system.repl` namespace has conveniences for REPL workflows. By
default, it will start and stop a named-system named `:donut.system/repl`, but
you can also specify a system:


``` clojure
(require '[donut.system :as ds])
(require '[donut.system.repl :as dsr])

;;---
;; By default, the named-system :donut.system.repl is used

(defmethod ds/named-system :donut.system/repl
  [_]
  {::ds/defs {:group {:component {::ds/start (fn [_] (println "starting :donut.system/repl"))
                                  ::ds/stop (fn [_] (println "stopping :donut.system/repl"))}}}})

(dsr/start)
;; => starting :donut.system/repl

;; => stopping :donut.system/repl

;; You can also use a different named-system

(defmethod ds/named-system :dev
  [_]
  {::ds/defs {:group {:component {::ds/start (fn [_] (println "starting :dev"))
                                  ::ds/stop (fn [_] (println "stopping :dev"))}}}})

(dsr/start :dev)
;; => starting :dev

(dsr/stop)
;; => stopping :dev

;; you can still override components
(dsr/start :dev {[:group :component ::ds/start] (fn [_] (println "override dev"))})
;; => override dev
```

`donut.system.repl/restart` will:

1. Stop the running system
2. Call `(clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh :after 'donut.system.repl/start)`

This will reload any changed files and then start your system again.

### Reloaded REPL with beholder

You can use the library [beholder](https://github.com/nextjournal/beholder) to
watch your file system for changes and automatically reload changes and restart
your system while you're developing it. Here's how I do it:

First, create the file `dev/src/user.clj` and put this in it:

``` clojure
(ns user)

(defn dev
  "Load and switch to the 'dev' namespace."
  []
  (require 'dev)
  (in-ns 'dev)
  :loaded)
```

Then create `dev/src/dev.clj` and put this in it:

``` clojure
(ns dev
  {:clj-kondo/config {:linters {:unused-namespace {:level :off}}}}
  (:require
   [clojure.tools.namespace.repl :as nsrepl]
   [dev.repl :as dev-repl]
   [donut.system :as ds]
   [donut.system.repl :as dsr]
   [donut.system.repl.state :as dsrs]
   [fluree.http-api.system :as sys])
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [test]))

(nsrepl/set-refresh-dirs "dev/src" "src" "test")

(defn routes
  []
  (get-in dsrs/system [::ds/defs :env :http/routes]))

(def start dsr/start)
(def stop dsr/stop)
(def restart dsr/restart)

(defmethod ds/named-system :donut.system/repl
  [_]
  (ds/system :dev))

(when-not dsrs/system
  (dsr/start))
```

Next create `dev/src/dev/repl.clj` and put this in it:

``` clojure
(ns dev.repl
  (:require [clojure.tools.namespace.repl :as repl]
            [donut.system.repl :as dsr]
            [nextjournal.beholder :as beholder]))

(repl/disable-reload!)

(defonce persistent-state (atom {}))

(defn- source-file? [path]
  (re-find #"(\.cljc?|\.edn)$" (str path)))

(defn- restart*
  [path]
  (when (source-file? path)
    (try
      (dsr/restart)
      (catch Exception e
        (println "Exception reloading:")
        (println e)))))

(defn- restart [ns]
  (fn [{:keys [path]}]
    (binding [*ns* ns]
      (restart* path))))

(def watcher
  (beholder/watch (restart *ns*) "src" "resources" "dev/src" "test"))

(comment
  (beholder/stop watcher))
```

 merge this configuration into your `deps.edn` file:

``` clojure
{:aliases
 {:dev
  {:extra-paths ["dev/src" "test"]
   :extra-deps  {com.nextjournal/beholder    {:mvn/version "1.0.0"}
                 org.clojure/tools.namespace {:mvn/version "1.1.0"}}}}}
```

By "merge" I mean that if you already have a `:dev` alias, add the values to it
in a way works for your project.

Once you've done this, you start a REPL with the `:dev` alias. If you use emacs,
you can add the following to your .emacs.d to have CIDER always include the dev
alias for REPLs:

``` clojure
(setq cider-clojure-cli-aliases ":dev")
```

After the REPL has started, call the `(dev)` function from the `user` namespace,
which is the default namespace. Calling `(dev)` will load the `dev` namespace
and switch to it, then start your system. It will also get beholder to do its
thing, watching the filesystem and reloading your namespaces and restarting your
system.

## Handling Failures

As you develop your project, it's likely an exception will get thrown when
you're trying to start your system. This can cause some resources to be claimed
without an obvious way to recover them. For example, your system might start an
HTTP server on port 8080, then throw an exception, leaving you without a clear
way to stop the HTTP server.

You can try to stop a failed system with the function
`donut.system/stop-failed-system`. Here's its source:

``` clojure
(defn stop-failed-system
  "Will attempt to stop a system that threw an exception when starting"
  []
  (when-let [system (and *e (::system (ex-data *e)))]
    (stop system)))
```

If you're trying to start a system using `donut.system.repl/start`, it will
automatically try to stop a failed system if an exception gets thrown.

## Organization and configuration

Where do you actually put your donut.system-related code? And how do you
handle configuration?

I recommend creating a `your-project.system` namespace to define your base system. It
might look something like this:

``` clojure
(ns you-project.system
  (:require
   [aero.core :as aero]
   [clojure.java.io :as io]
   [donut.system :as ds]
   [ring.adapter.jetty :as rj]))

;; Use aero for all configuration
(defn env-config [& [profile]]
  (aero/read-config (io/resource "config/env.edn")
                    (when profile {:profile profile})))

;; define all behavior in base-system
(def base-system
  {::ds/defs
   {:env {}

    :http
    {:server
     #::ds{:start  (fn [{{:keys [handler options]} ::ds/config}]
                     (rj/run-jetty handler options))
           :stop   (fn [{::ds/keys [instance]}]
                     (.stop instance))
           :config {:handler (ds/ref [:http :handler])
                    :options {:port  (ds/ref [:env :http-port])
                              :join? false}}}

     :handler
     #::ds{:start (fn [_]
                    ;; handler goes here
                    )}}}})

(defmethod ds/named-system :base
  [_]
  base-system)

(defmethod ds/named-system :dev
  [_]
  (ds/system :base {[:env] (env-config :dev)}))

(defmethod ds/named-system :donut.system/repl
  [_]
  (ds/system :dev))

(defmethod ds/named-system :test
  [_]
  (ds/system :dev
    {[:http :server] ::disabled}))
```

Note that this system contains an `:env` group. Other components can reference
values in the `:env` group for their configuration. The `[:http :server]`
component does this for its port.

Additionally, refs can "reach" farther into the referenced component. For
example, this would work:

``` clojure
(def base-system
  {::ds/defs
   {:env
    {:http {:port 8080}}

    :http 
    {:server
     #::ds{:start  (fn [{{:keys [handler options]} ::ds/config}]
                     (rj/run-jetty handler options))
           :config {:handler (ds/ref :handler)
                    :options {:port  (ds/ref [:env :http :port])
                              :join? false}}}}}})
```

Note the second-to-last-line includes `(ds/ref [:env :http :port])` - this will
correctly reference the HTTP port.

As your system grows, you'll probably want to move components into separate
namespaces. Your system map might then look something like this:

``` clojure
(def base-system
  {::ds/defs
   {:env {}

    :http 
    {:server  http/server
     :handler http/handler}}})
```

## Testing

How do you test an application that uses donut.system? There are three main
concerns:

- Starting and stopping your system
- Accessing component instances
- Mocking components

Let's look at each, using this test system:

``` clojure
(defmethod ds/named-system ::test
  [_]
  {::ds/defs
   {:group-a
    {:component-a
     {::ds/start (fn [_] (atom []))}}

    :group-b
    {:component-b
     {::ds/start  (fn [opts]
                    ;; add an element to the `[:group-a :component-a]` atom on
                    ;; start
                    (swap! (get-in opts [::ds/config :component-a])
                           conj
                           :foo))
      ::ds/config {:component-a (ds/ref [:group-a :component-a])}}}}})
```

### Starting and stopping your system

There are three main options you can choose from to start and stop your system:

#### Method 1: use a `let` binding

``` clojure
(deftest your-test
  (let [system (ds/start ::test)]
    (is (= [:foo]
           @(get-in system [::ds/instances :group-a :component-a])))
    (ds/stop system)))
```

#### Method 2: `with-*system*`

The `donut.system` namespace has a dynamic var, `*system*`, and a macro that
handles some of the machinery of working with it:

``` clojure
(deftest using-with-*system*
  (ds/with-*system* ::test
    (is (= [:foo]
           @(get-in ds/*system* [::ds/instances :group-a :component-a])))))
```

The macro's first argument is either a system map or a system name. The macro
will start the system and bind the started system map to `ds/*system*`. It will
also stop the system.

#### Method 3: `system-fixture`

The function `ds/system-fixture` returns a function that can be used as a
`clojure.test` fixture:

``` clojure
(use-fixtures :each (ds/system-fixture ::test))

(deftest using-fixture
  (is (= [:foo]
         @(get-in ds/*system* [::ds/instances :group-a :component-a]))))
```

Just be careful not to mix this method with method 2. If you do that you'll end
up starting two different systems, and that could cause hard-to-debug problems.

### Accessing component instances

Once you have a started system, you can access component instances under the
system's `::ds/instances` key. You can also use the function `ds/instance`:

``` clojure
(deftest retrieving-instances
  (ds/with-*system* ::test
    ;; one way to retrieve an instance
    (is (= [:foo]
           @(get-in ds/*system* [::ds/instances :group-a :component-a])))

    ;; another way to retrieve an instance
    (is (= [:foo]
           @(ds/instance ds/*system* [:group-a :component-a])))))
```

The advantage of using `ds/instance` is that it will throw an exception if
you're trying to get an instance for an undefined component, which can help you
catch typos.

### Mocking Components

When you're writing tests, you'll sometimes want to mock out components. For
example, if you have an Amazon SQS queue, you might want to mock out the client rather
than trying to connect to an actual SQS queue over the network. When you use the
`ds/start` or `ds/system` functions, you can provide a map of component
overrides, as covered above in the [config helpers](#config-helpers) section.
Here's what that might look like:

``` clojure
(deftest with-override
  ;; method 1
  (let [test-atom (atom [])]
    (ds/start ::test {[:group-a :component-a] test-atom})
    (is (= [:foo] @test-atom)))

  ;; method 2 - the first argument to `ds/with-*system*` can be either a system
  ;; name or a system map. In this example we're getting a system map.
  (let [test-atom (atom [])]
    (ds/with-*system* (ds/system ::test {[:group-a :component-a] test-atom})
      (is (= [:foo] @test-atom)))))
```

# Advanced usage

The topics covered so far should let you get started defining components and
systems in your own projects. donut.system can also handle more complex use
cases.

## Groups and local refs

All component definitions are organized into groups. As someone who compulsively
lines up pens and straightens stacks of brochures, I think this extra level of
tidiness is inherently good and needs no further explanation.

The inclusion of component groups unlocks some useful capabilities that are less
obvious, though, so let's talk about those. Component groups make it easier to:

- Create multiple instances of a component
- Send signals to selections of components
- Designate system stages

I'll describe what I mean by "multiple instances" here, and I'll explain the
rest in later sections.

Let's say for some reason you want to run multiple HTTP servers. Here's how you
could do that:

``` clojure
(ns donut.examples.multiple-http-servers
  (:require
   [donut.system :as ds]
   [ring.adapter.jetty :as rj]))


(def HTTPServer
  #::ds{:start  (fn [{{:keys [handler options]} ::ds/config}]
                  (rj/run-jetty handler options))
        :stop   (fn [{::ds/keys [instance]}]
                  (.stop instance))
        :config {:handler (ds/local-ref [:handler])
                 :options {:port  (ds/local-ref [:port])
                           :join? false}}})

(def system
  {::ds/defs
   {:http-1 {:server  HTTPServer
             :handler (fn [_req]
                        {:status  200
                         :headers {"ContentType" "text/html"}
                         :body    "http server 1"})
             :port    8080}

    :http-2 {:server  HTTPServer
             :handler (fn [_req]
                        {:status  200
                         :headers {"ContentType" "text/html"}
                         :body    "http server 2"})
             :port    9090}}})
```

First, we define the component `HTTPServer`. Notice that it has two refs,
`(ds/local-ref [:handler])` and `(ds/local-ref [:port])`. These differ from the
refs you've seen so far, which have been created with `ds/ref`. Refs created
with `ds/local-ref` are, well, _local refs_, and will resolve to the component
of the given name within the same group.

This little sprinkling of abstraction creates more possibilities for component
modularity and reuse. You could create multiple instances of an HTTP server
without groups, sure, but it would be more tedious and typo-prone. The fact is,
some components actually are part of a group, so it makes sense to have
first-class support for groups.

## Selecting components

The `system` function takes an optional third argument that lets you specify
what components you want to use:

``` clojure
(ds/system :named-system {} #{[:group-1 :component-1]})
(ds/system
  {;; first argument can also be a system map
  }
  {}
  #{[:group-1 :component-1]})
```

The purpose of specifying components like this is to limit what components
receive signals. This might come in handy in testing, where you might want to
work with only a subset of all system components.

When you select components, the entire subgraph of component dependencies get
selected too; you don't have to include all those dependencies in your
selection. For example with this:

``` clojure
(ds/signal (ds/system :test {} #{[:group-1 :component-1]}) ::ds/start)
```

The `::ds/start` signal gets sent to the component `[:group-1 :component-1]` as
well as all the components it depends on.

You can also select component groups by using just the group's name for your
selection, like so:

``` clojure
(ds/system system {} #{:group-1})
```

## Stages

It might be useful to signal parts of your system in stages. For example, you
might want to instantiate a logger and error reporter and use those if an
exception is thrown when starting other components:

``` clojure
;; This is mostly pseudocode
(def system
  {::ds/defs
   {:boot {:logger         #::ds{:start ...
                                 :stop  ...}
           :error-reporter #::ds{:start ...
                                 :stop  ...}}
    :app  {:server #::ds{:start ...}}}})

(let [booted-system  (ds/start system {} #{:boot})
      logger         (get-in booted-system [::ds/instances :boot :logger])
      error-reporter (get-in booted-system [::ds/instances :boot :error-reporter])]
  (try (ds/signal booted-system :start)
       (catch Exception e
         (log logger e)
         (report-error error-report e))))
```

Note that you would need to make the `::ds/start` handlers for `:logger` and
`:error-reporter` _idempotent_, meaning that calling `::ds/start` on an
already-started component should not create a new instance but use an existing
one. The code would look something like this:

``` clojure
(fn [{::ds/keys [config instance]}]
  (or instance
      (create-logger config)))
```

### Selecting components

The `select-components` function takes two arguments, a system and a set of
component-ids. It returns a new system with component selection noted, so that
when you send signals to the new system the signals are only sent to the selected
components and the components they depend on (recursively):

``` clojure
(ds/select-components system #{[:group-a :component-a] [:group-b :component-b]})
```

If you call `ds/start` on this, then only `[:group-a :component-a]` and
`[:group-b :component-b]` will receive the start signal, as well as all the
components they depend on.

If you include a keyword in the selected components set, like
`(ds/select-components system #{:boot})`, then all components in that group will
be selected.

The `ds/start` function can optionally take a set of selected components as a
third argument.

### Selecting all components

If you want to remove the component selection, you can either `dissoc` the key
`::ds/selected-components` from your system map or call `select-components` with
nil: `(ds/select-components system nil)`

## Pre, post, validation, and "channels"

You can define `pre-` and `post-` handlers for signals:

``` clojure
(def system
  {::ds/defs
   {:app {:server #::ds{:pre-start (fn [_] (prn "pre-start"))
                        :start        (fn [_] (prn "start"))
                        :post-start  (fn [_] (prn "post-start"))}}}})
```

You can use these _lifecycle handlers_ to gather information about your system
as it handles signals, and to perform validation. Let's look at a couple use
cases: printing signal progress and validating configs.

Here's how you might print signal progress:

``` clojure
(defn print-progress
  [{::ds/keys [system]}]
  (prn (::ds/component-id system)))

(def system
  {::ds/defs
   {:group {:component-a #::ds{:start       "component a"
                               :post-start print-progress}
            :component-b #::ds{:start       "component b"
                               :post-start print-progress}}}})

(ds/signal system ::ds/start)
;; =>
[:group :component-a]
[:group :component-b]
```

The function `print-progress` is used as the `:post-start` handler for both
`:component-a` and `:component-b`. It destructures `::ds/system`, then prints
`(::ds/component-id system)`.

That's right: signal handlers are passed the entire system under the
`::ds/system` key of their argument. The current component's id gets assoc'd
into the system map under `::ds/component-id` prior to calling a signal handler.

The handler argument also has a collection of "channel" functions merged into it
which we can use to gather information about components and perform validation.
Look at how we destructure `->info` and `->validation` from the third argument
in these `:post-start` handlers:

``` clojure
(def system
  {::ds/defs
   {:group {:component-a #::ds{:start       "component a"
                               :post-start (fn [{:keys [->info]}]
                                              (->info "component a is valid"))}
            :component-b #::ds{:start       "component b"
                               :post-start (fn [{:keys [->validation]}]
                                              (->validation "component b is invalid"))
                               ;; This `:config` is only here to create the
                               ;; dependency order for demonstration purpose
                               :config      {:ref (ds/ref :component-a)}}
            :component-c #::ds{:start       "component-c"
                               :post-start (fn [_]
                                              (prn "this won't print"))
                               ;; This `:config` is only here to create the
                               ;; dependency order for demonstration purpose
                               :config      {:ref (ds/ref :component-b)}}}}})


(::ds/out (ds/signal system ::ds/start))
;; =>
{:info       {:group {:component-a "component a is valid"}},
 :validation {:group {:component-b "component b is invalid"}}}
```

Notice that `:component-c`'s `:post-start` handler doesn't get called. As it
predicts, the string "this won't print" doesn't get printed.

It's not obvious what's going on here, so let's step through it.

1. `:component-a`'s `:post-start` gets called first. It destructures the
   `->info` function out of the third argument. `->info` is a _channel function_
   and its purpose is to allow signal handlers to place a value somewhere in the
   system map in a convenient and consistent way. `->info` assoc'd into the
   system map before a signal handler is called, and it closes is over the
   "output path", which includes the current component id. This is why when you
   call `(->info "component a is valid")`, the string `"component a is valid"`
   ends up at the path `[::ds/out :info :group :component-a]`.
2. `(->info "component a is valid")` returns a system map, and that updated
   system map is conveyed forward to other components' signal handlers, until a
   final system map is returned by `ds/signal`.
   
   But what if you want to use `:post-start` to perform a side effect? What
   then?? Do these functions always have to return a system map?
   
   No. The rules for handling return values are:
   
   1. If a system map is returned, convey that forward
   2. Otherwise, check whether the signal handler is flagged as returning an
      instance. This is configured under `[::ds/signals :signal-name
      :returns-instance?]`. If that value is true, use the return value to
      update the instance value.
   3. Otherwise, ignore the return value.
3. `(->validation "component b is invalid")` is similar to `->info` in that it
   places a value in the system map. However, it differs in that it also has
   implicit control flow semantics: if at any point a value is placed under
   `[::ds/out :validation]`, then the library will stop trying to send signals
   to that component's descendants. (It's actually a little more nuanced than
   that, and I cover those nuances below.)

One way you could make use of these features is to write something like this:

``` clojure
(ns donut.examples.validate
  (:require
   [donut.system :as ds]
   [malli.core :as m]))

(defn validate-config
  [{:keys [->validation ::ds/config]}]
  (when-let [schema (:schema config)]
    (when-let [errors (m/explain schema (dissoc config :schema))]
      (->validation errors))))

(def system
  {::ds/defs
   {:group {:component-a #::ds{:pre-start validate-config
                               :start        "component a"
                               :config       {:schema [:map [:foo any?] [:baz any?]]}}
            :component-b #::ds{:pre-start validate-config
                               :start        "component b"
                               :config       {:schema [:map [:foo any?] [:baz any?]]}}
            :component-c #::ds{:start "component-c"}}}})
```

We can create a generic `validate-component` function that checks whether a
component's definition contains a `:schema` key, and use that to validate the
rest of the component definition.

## ::ds/base

You can add `::ds/base` key to a system map to define a "base" component
definition that will get merged with the rest of your component defs. The last
example could be rewritten like this:

``` clojure
(ns donut.examples.validate
  (:require
   [donut.system :as ds]
   [malli.core :as m]))

(defn validate-config
  [{:keys [->validation ::ds/config]}]
  (when-let [schema (:schema config)]
    (when-let [errors (m/explain schema config)]
      (->validation errors))))

(def system
  {::ds/base #::ds{:pre-start validate-config}
   ::ds/defs
   {:group {:component-a {:start  "component a"
                          :schema [:map [:foo any?] [:baz any?]]}
            :component-b {:start  "component b"
                          :schema [:map [:foo any?] [:baz any?]]}
            :component-c {:start "component-c"}}}})
```

## Caching Component Instances

Sometimes you don't want a component to stop and start every time a system
restarts. For example, if you have a threadpool component, you don't want to
tear it down and recreate it constantly. A couple scenarios where this isn't
desirable:

* You've set up a [reloaded REPL workflow](#reloaded-repl-workflow) and don't
  want to restart your threadpool every time you save a file
* You're starting and stopping a system for every test, and don't want to
  restart that threadpool between tests
  
To cache a component, pass its def to the `ds/cache-component` function. This
test demonstrates:

``` clojure
(deftest caching
  (reset! ds/component-instance-cache {})
  (let [counter (atom 0)
        system  {::ds/defs
                 {:group
                  {:component (ds/cache-component
                               {::ds/start (fn [_] (swap! counter inc))
                                ::ds/stop  (fn [_] (swap! counter + 10))})}}}]
    (ds/start system)
    (is (= 1 @counter))
    (ds/stop system)
    (is (= 1 @counter))

    (ds/start system)
    (is (= 1 @counter))

    ;; if you clear the cache then the stop signal will go through
    (reset! ds/component-instance-cache {})
    (ds/stop system)
    (is (= 11 @counter))))
```

## Plugins

One of donut.system's overarching goals is to provide a foundation for a richer
ecosystem of composable libraries so that an application developer can easily
integrate some vertical slice of functionality with minimal fiddling. The plugin
system is meant to provide a clear interface for this kind of extension.

### Using a plugin

To use a plugin, add it to a vector under `::ds/plugins` in your system map:

``` clojure
{::ds/defs {}
 ::ds/plugins [some-plugin]}
```

### Inspecting plugins

I want it to be easy to understand what a plugin has done to your system. Right
now, the function `donut.system.plugin` can take a system as an argument and
produce descriptions of how each plugin has modified the system.

### Defining a plugin

Plugins modify a system map, adding or modifying values. They're defined as maps
with the following keys:

**`:donut.system.plugin/name`**

A keyword

**`:donut.system.plugin/doc`**

Not currently used, but this is where a docstring goes

**`:donut.system.plugin/system-defaults`**

This gets merged with a system via `(merge system-defaults system)`, meaning
that any values in your system map take precedence over those in the plugin.

**`:donut.system.plugin/system-merge`**

This gets merge with a system via `(merge system system-merge)`, meaning that
plugin values will take precedence over those already in the system.

**`:donut.system.plugin/system-update`**

This is a function that takes a system as an argument and returns a new system.
For cases where you need some extra logic in updating a system definition.


Example plugin definition:

``` clojure
(def test-harness-plugin
  {:donut.system.plugin/name
   ::test-harness-plugin

   :donut.system.plugin/doc
   "Configures system so that donut.endpoint.test.harness can find the
   components needed to construct and dispatch requests."

   :donut.system.plugin/system-defaults
   {::ds/registry {:donut/endpoint-router [:routing :router]
                   :donut/http-handler    [:http :handler]}
    ::ds/defs     {::config {:default-request-content-type :transit-json}}}})
```

## Subsystems

Woe be unto you if you ever have to compose a system from subsystems. But if you
do, I've tried to make it straightforward. Check it out:

``` clojure
(ns donut.examples.subsystem
  (:require [donut.system :as ds]))

(defn mk-print-thread
  [prefix stack]
  (doto (Thread.
         (fn []
           (prn prefix (peek @stack))
           (swap! stack pop)
           (Thread/sleep 1000)
           (recur)))
    (.start)))

(defn print-worker-system
  [print-prefix]
  {::ds/defs
   {:workers
    {:print-worker #::ds{:start  (fn [{{:keys [stack]} ::ds/config}]
                                   (mk-print-thread print-prefix stack))
                         :stop   (fn [{::ds/keys [instance]}]
                                   (.stop instance))
                         :config {:stack (ds/ref [:services :stack])}}}}})

(def system
  {::ds/defs
   {:services {:stack #::ds{:start (fn [_] (atom (vec (range 20))))
                            :stop  (fn [{::ds/keys [instance]}] (reset! instance []))}}
    :printers {:printer-1 (ds/subsystem-component
                           (print-worker-system ":printer-1")
                           #{(ds/ref [:services])})
               :printer-2 (ds/subsystem-component
                           (print-worker-system ":printer-2")
                           #{(ds/ref [:services :stack])})}}})
```

In this example, we're creating two subsystems (`[:printers printer-1]` and
`[:printers :printer-2]`) that pop items from a shared stack component defined
in the parent system, `[:services :stack]`.

We generate definitions for the subsystems with the function
`print-worker-system`, which returns a system definition with one component,
`[:workers :print-worker]`. The component def has a key, `:stack`, which
references `[:services :stack]`, but notice that there is no `[:services
:stack]` component in the `print-worker-system` definition.

Internally, the parent system wraps these subsystems with a call to
`ds/subsystem-component`. `ds/subsystem-component` returns a component def, a
map with a `::ds/start` signal handler that "forwards" the signal to the
subsystem. The component def also includes the key `::ds/mk-signal-handler`, a
privileged key that acts as default signal handler. `::ds/mk-signal-handler` is
responsible for forwarding all other signals to the subsystem.

`ds/subsystem-component` takes an optional second argument, a set of refs that
should be imported into the subsystem. This is how the subsystems can reference
the parent system's component `[:services :stack]`.

# Purpose

Now that we've covered how to use the library, let's talk about why you'd use
it.

When building a non-trivial Clojure application you're faced with some questions
that don't have obvious answers:

- How do I write code that's understandable and maintainable?
- How do I manage resources like database connections and thread pools?
- How do I manage test environments?

donut.system helps you address these problems by giving you tools for
encapsulating behavior in *components* and composing components into *systems*.

## Architecture aid

We can make application code more understandable and maintainable by identifying
a system's responsibilities and organizing code around those responsibilities so
that they can be considered and developed in isolation - in other words,
defining a system architecture an implementing it with healthy doses of loose
coupling and encapsulation.

It's not obvious how to do implement and convey your system's architecture in a
functional programming language like Clojure, where it's pretty much one giant
pool of functions, and boundaries (namespaces, marking functions private) are
more like swim lanes you can easily duck under than walls enforcing isolation.

Using a component library like donut.system is one way for you to introduce such
boundaries. When you program with components, you clarify your application's
functional concerns, you codify (literally!) the relationships between different
parts of your system, and you make the interfaces between them explicit. You
avoid creating a codebase where any random function can access any random
state - part of why you got into Clojure in the first place.

Components facilitate writing loosely-coupled code. The benefits of that are
well documented, but I'll briefly mention a couple here:

- Loosely-coupled code is easier to understand because it reduces the scope of the
  system you have to have in your head to understand what something is doing.
- Loosely-coupled code is easier to maintain because it reduces the scope of
  impact from changes.

Components also aid discoverability. A system definition serves as a map that
outlines the major "territories" of functionality, as well the entry point to
each.

## Resource management

donut.system helps allocate and deallocate resources like database connections
and thread pools in the correct order. It also provides a systematic approach to
accessing resources. When building an application, you have to manage these
tasks _somehow_; a component library like donut.system gives you the tools to
manage them in a consistent way.

I have a half-baked thought about component libraries serving a purpose similar
to tools like [systemd](https://systemd.io/), though in a much more limited
scope. I'm not sure exactly where you want to go with it, but: component
libraries are useful in building an application for reasons similar to why
systemd is useful in managing a machine. In both cases, you want some consistent
method for starting and stopping the actors in a computing environment. This
work is not central to whatever business problem you're trying to solve, but it
still has to get done, so it's nice to be able to use a tool that does that work
for you that you can learn once and use across different projects.

## Virtual environment

donut.system (and other component libraries) provide a kind of light-weight
virtual environment for your application. Usually there's one-to-one
relationship between a running process and a running application; component
systems make it possible to run many instances of an application within a single
process.

The biggest benefit this brings is the ability to run dev and test systems at
the same time. I can start a dev system with an HTTP server and a dev db
connection from the REPL, and from the same REPL run integration tests with a
separate HTTP server and db connection. It's a huge workflow improvement.

## Framework foundation

donut.system's component definitions are _just data_, which means that it's
possible for libraries to provide components that work with donut.system without
actually including a donut.system dependency. A library like
[cronut](https://github.com/troy-west/cronut), for example, could include the
following map for easy consumption in a donut.system project:

``` clojure
(def CronutComponent
  :donut.system{:start (fn [{:donut.system/keys [config]}] (initialize config))
                :stop  (fn [{:donut.system/keys [instance]}] (shutdown instance))})
```

What if you want to define a component group without depending on donut.system?
You might want to do this if you have a collection of related components that
have local refs to each other. Here's how you could do that:

``` clojure
(def CoolLibComponentGroup
  {:component-a #:donut.system{:start (fn [_] ...)}
   :component-b #:donut.system{:start  (fn [{{:keys [component-a]} :donut.system/config}])
                               :config {:component-a [:donut.system/ref :component-a]}}})
```

The key is that refs are represented with the vector `[:donut.system/ref
ref-key]`.

Whether or not this is actually a good idea remains to be seen, but my hope is
that it will provide a better foundation for writing higher-level, composable
libraries.

# Objections

Over the years, I've encountered two main objections to this approach:

- It forces premature abstraction
- It's too complex

TODO address these concerns. (They're not necessarily wrong!)
